Tesla Taps Robyn Denholm To Replace Elon Musk As Board Chair

Tesla said company director Robyn Denholm will replace Elon Musk as its board chair, fulfilling a key requirement of Securities and Exchange Commission settlement that arose from the billionaire entrepreneur’s ill-advised tweets about taking the company private.

The selection of Denholm, who joined Tesla's board in 2014, indicates a preference for an independent executive who's also highly familiar with the company's expanding auto and energy businesses. In accepting the job, she'll leave her position as CFO and head of strategy for Australia’s Telstra Corp. to focus full time on Tesla, the electric-car company said in a statement.

“I believe in this company, I believe in its mission and I look forward to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value,” Robyn said in a blog post.

The move comes ahead of a deadline — apparently next week — for Musk to relinquish the chairman role he’s held since 2004. While he's allowed to retain a board seat, the Palo Alto, California-based company must also add two new independent board members by about year-end to reduce what appears to have been a high degree of compliance with the charismatic executive’s wishes.

The SEC filed suit against Musk in September claiming his August 7 comments on Twitter of having “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share constituted securities fraud since that statement was untrue and he knew it, or should have.
